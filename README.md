## A Little Bit About Myself

I am a creative, self-motivated Full Stack Software Engineer with an eye for design and a passion for making ideas come to life. I'm an enthusiastic learner and am always looking to improve and gain new skills. A natural team player with previous managerial experience and a history of delivering successful projects, I am passionate about building elegant solutions to real problems.

Having spent the last eight years in Banking, Music, Film and Television, I decided to retrain as a Software Engineer to combine two passions. Making things and technology. I have always loved seeing an instant output for my work, and find that I get the same creative buzz writing code as I do when making music, working in film, or even cooking food. Being able to produce creative products from a technical codebase is extremely exciting to me as you are limited only by your imagination.

## Skills

**Fast learner** - In my final project at Makers, we chose to use React.js, Node.js, React-Canvas and Spotify APIs. No one in my team had experience in either of the four and we had a deadline of two weeks. However, due to our persistence and commitment to the project we managed to create a fully original music visualizer.

**Team player** - I have excellent interpersonal skills and fit into a team naturally; I am able to follow an AGILE workflow when taking instructions and when in a leadership role. During a team project to build a Facebook clone, I hosted morning stand-ups, evening retrospectives and guided feedback sessions. 

**Problem Solver** - Although I am highly motivated by results and love seeing my teams hard work up in bright lights, getting there is half the fun. I thrive when I find myself reverse engineering my way out of a sticky situation. If I don’t know the answer, you will most likley find me either Googling the problem or searching Stack Overflow looking for a soloution! In my spare time for fun I enjoy gaming, solving puzzles, and more recently solving kata’s on codewars.

**Design** - Since I was a child, I have been interested in art and still enjoy painting aswell as designing concepts on my laptop. This combined with my passion for music production and its software gives me an in-depth understanding of how great design fuels an excellent user experience. Because of this, I started teaching myself HTML, CSS and Bootstrap alongside the out lined course materials at Makers. I take pride in my code, and I also take pride in the quality of the finished product.
